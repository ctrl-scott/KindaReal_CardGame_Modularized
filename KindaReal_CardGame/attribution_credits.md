# Credits
Hereâ€™s the full attribution list. Short version: everything was authored in this chat; no third-party code, libraries, images, or fonts were used. We only relied on a few well-known, public-domain/standard algorithms by name:

* **Gameplay, card lists, balance, UI, and SVG art**
  Original, written in this conversation based on your requests (no external assets).

* **Shuffle algorithm**
  *Fisherâ€“Yates* (modern Durstenfeld in-place variant) â€” classic method for unbiased shuffling; implemented from scratch here.

* **Seeded RNG**
  *Mulberry32* PRNG (public domain, attributed to Tommy Ettinger) â€” small deterministic generator used when a text seed is applied.

* **Seed hashing**
  *FNV-1a* (Fowlerâ€“Nollâ€“Vo) 32-bit hash (offset basis `2166136261`, prime `16777619`) to turn a text seed into a 32-bit state.

* **Tiebreaker logic**
  Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors selection/compare (simple table logic), implemented directly.

* **Accessibility pattern**
  Basic WAI-ARIA live region pattern (`aria-live="assertive"`) for log announcements; implemented directly.

This is based off of [https://chatgpt.com/share/68aeff40-0270-800c-ac85-44a8b5d3d190] which is disconnected from other chats used to create the game (which I will list below).

The below sources will be from prior chats of the game design, [https://chatgpt.com/share/68aef260-e274-800c-b7cb-753ef2b744f4].
