# KindaReal_CardGame
Utilizing ChatGPT to bring a kind of real card game HTML JS CSS based

This is for demonstration purposes only. I did not become involved in other widely popular table or card games heavily at any point in my life. This is a game based off of recent years. 

The logic is not completely sound, I am using ChatGPT, there have to be all sorts of adjustments (no pun intended).

None of this is representative of any American Law, American Official, or American Interaction with L.E. - it is only an idealistic card game based off of my American Life.

Another caveat is that ChatGPT does a lot of the generation and based off the massive amounts of data and computing, most of this is left up to chance, except working on the logic, so nevermind all the labels within the card game itself.

In it's simplest form, I and the card game are trying to convey an idea in an interactive way.
