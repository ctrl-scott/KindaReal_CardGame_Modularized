Great question!

# Code Page 437 (CP437)

**Code Page 437**, also known as **IBM PC US** or **OEM-US**, was the **original character set** of the IBM PC introduced in 1981. It’s an **8-bit code page** (values 0–255) that extends standard ASCII (0–127) with **128 additional characters**.

---

## Key Features

1. **ASCII-compatible base (0–127)**

   * The first half of CP437 is standard 7-bit ASCII: letters A–Z, digits 0–9, punctuation, and control codes.

2. **Box-drawing characters**

   * Characters like ─, │, ┌, ┐, └, ┘ allowed programmers to draw tables, menus, and windows in **text mode applications**.

3. **Block and shading characters**

   * ░, ▒, ▓, █ enabled ASCII art and graphical effects (progress bars, logos, “ANSI art”).

4. **Math and symbols**

   * Includes characters like π, Σ, ±, ÷, √ for use in technical applications.

5. **International letters**

   * Contains accented characters for Western European languages (é, ñ, ö, ç, etc.).

---

## Why It Matters

* **Text Mode UI**: Early MS-DOS programs relied on CP437 box-drawing characters to create user interfaces before GUIs were common.
* **NFO and ANSI art**: Artists used CP437 extensively for bulletin board system (BBS) art in the 1980s and 1990s. Many `.NFO` files still use CP437 to this day.
* **Legacy compatibility**: CP437 is still referenced in Unicode as the source of many symbols. For example, Unicode blocks like *Box Drawing* and *Block Elements* were created to preserve CP437 art.

## Example (Box-drawing demo in CP437)

```
╔══════════════════╗
║   CP437 Rocks!   ║
╚══════════════════╝
```

This is text only — drawn using CP437 characters.

## Relation to Unicode

* Unicode incorporated all CP437 glyphs, so modern systems can display them (if the correct font is chosen).
* For example:

  * CP437 `0xB3` → Unicode U+2502 `│`
  * CP437 `0xC4` → Unicode U+2500 `─`
  * CP437 `0xDB` → Unicode U+2588 `█`

✅ **In short:** CP437 was the *“default alphabet”* of the original IBM PC, mixing letters, symbols, and line-drawing characters. It became the artistic toolkit for early computer users.

Would you like me to generate a **full CP437 reference table (0–255) with their Unicode equivalents** in Markdown so you can use it inside your NFO/Markdown viewer docs?
